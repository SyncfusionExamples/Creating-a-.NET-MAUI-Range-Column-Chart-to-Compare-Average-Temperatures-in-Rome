# Creating-a-.NET-MAUI-Range-Column-Chart-to-Compare-Average-Temperatures-in-Rome
A range column chart is a valuable tool for visualizing data intervals, enabling comparisons between categories or time periods. It's particularly useful for showing variations and trends in data sets with upper and lower values.

This sample demonstrates how to create a Range Column Chart to compare average temperatures in Rome using .NET MAUI (SfCartesianChart).

### Customizing Chart Appearance
We can customize the chart appearance by the following ways:

#### Customizing Range Column Series Placement
We can customize the Cartesian chart by choosing whether the Range Column series should be placed side by side or overlapped.

#### Adding a chart title
A chart title provides essential context to the plotted data

#### Chart Axis Customization
We can further customize axis elements, including axis label style, axis label placement, and adjusting the axis range.

#### Chart series Customization
We can customize the chart series by applying the desired series color, and enabling or customizing data labels for each series in the chart.

#### Chart Legend Customization
The legend provides information about the data point displayed in the chart.
